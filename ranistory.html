            An NGO Rescued a group of small children begging on the streets of
            Pune, where they "worked" for a contractor who fed them barely
            Enough to survive but plied them through the day with hallucinogenic
            drugs to make them do his bidding. This heartless man had been on
            the verge of sending some of the small girls for further
            exploitation of a horrendous type. They were rescued from his
            clutches in the nick of time. Seventeen years ago, three of these
            half-starved children were Brought to Sumati Balwan and we took them

            in. Rani chose to stay with Pakharmaya, contributing as a food
            instructor and managing the farm. She also launched a small business
            making traditional snacks, which gained popularity and allowed her
            to support herself and contribute financially to Pakharmaya. Today,
            Rani is a beloved member of the Pakharmaya family, embodying
            independence and resilience. Her journey from a rescued child to a
            self-sufficient woman highlights the transformative power of a
            nurturing environment and pursuing one's passions.
